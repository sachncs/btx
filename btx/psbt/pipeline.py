"""Multi-process PSBT processing pipeline.

Provides :func:`process_psbt_batch` for parsing multiple PSBT files in
parallel (with ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` for CPU-bound work) and
:func:`process_psbt_batch_with` for parsing and then applying a
caller-supplied transform to each result.

Both functions return a :class:`PsbtBatchResult` aggregating the
successfully parsed PSBTs alongside any errors, so a single malformed
file does not abort the whole batch.  Each batch is tagged with a
short request ID (UUID4 first 12 hex digits) for log correlation.

The worker function :func:`parse_psbt_worker` is intentionally
defined at module scope so it can be pickled and dispatched across
process boundaries by :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.
